## Discussion

The presentOfferCodeRedeemSheet(in:) method displays a system sheet in the window scene, where customers can enter and redeem subscription offer codes. If you generate subscription offer codes in App Store Connect, call this function to enable users to redeem the offer. To display the sheet using SwiftUI, see offerCodeRedemption(isPresented:onCompletion:).

Important

Set up subscription offer codes in App Store Connect before calling this API. Customers can only redeem these offers in your app through the redemption sheet; donâ€™t use a custom UI.

For more information on offer codes, see Supporting subscription offer codes in your app.

When customers redeem an offer code, StoreKit emits the resulting transaction in updates. Set up a transaction listener as soon as your app launches to receive new transactions while the app is running. For more information, see updates.

In Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, this method throws a StoreKitError.unknown error.
