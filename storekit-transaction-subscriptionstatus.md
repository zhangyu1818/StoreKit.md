var subscriptionStatus: Product.SubscriptionInfo.Status? { get async }
```

## Discussion

This value is `nil` if the product in the transaction isnâ€™t an auto-renewable subscription, specifically, if the productType is anything other than autoRenewable.

The array can have more than one subscription status, for example, if your subscription supports Family Sharing. Provide the customer with service for the subscription based on the highest level of service where the subscription status is subscribed.
