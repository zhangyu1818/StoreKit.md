## Discussion

The renewalDate is a value thatâ€™s always present for auto-renewable subscriptions, even for expired subscriptions. This date indicates the expiration date of the most recent auto-renewable subscription purchase, including renewals, and may be in the past. For subscriptions that renew successfully, the renewalDate is the date when the subscription renews.
