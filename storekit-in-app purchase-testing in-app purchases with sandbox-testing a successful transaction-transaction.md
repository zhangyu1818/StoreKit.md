# Testing a successful transaction

Confirm that your app can make a successful transaction in the sandbox environment by inspecting the transaction.

## Overview

Set a breakpoint in your implementation of the transaction queue observerâ€™s paymentQueue(_:updatedTransactions:) method. Then sign in to the App Store with a Sandbox Apple ID, and make a purchase in your app. Inspect the transaction to verify that its status is SKPaymentTransactionState.purchased.

Set a breakpoint at the point in your code where your app stores the purchase, and confirm that your code saves the data in response to a successful purchase. Inspect the user default or iCloud key-value store, to verify that your code correctly records the information. For more information on saving data in response to a successful purchase, see Persisting a purchase.
