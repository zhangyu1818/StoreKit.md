## Discussion

This field indicates whether Apple is attempting to automatically renew an expired subscription. If a subscription expires due to a billing issue, a value of `true` indicates that Apple is still trying to renew the subscription. If the subscription is in a billing grace period, the optional gracePeriodExpirationDate contains a date.

Use the isInBillingRetry value along with expirationReason for more insight, as the following table shows:

| Values | Description |
|----|----|
| isInBillingRetry is `false,`  expirationReason is `nil` | The auto-renewable subscription is active and not in a billing retry period.  The subscription is entitled to service. |
| isInBillingRetry is `true,`  expirationReason is billingError,  gracePeriodExpirationDate has a date | The auto-renewable subscription is in a billing grace period.  The subscription is entitled to service until the date in gracePeriodExpirationDate. |
| isInBillingRetry is `true,`  expirationReason is billingError,  gracePeriodExpirationDate is `nil` | The auto-renewable subscription is in a billing retry period.  The subscription is not entitled to service. |
| isInBillingRetry is `false,`  expirationReason is billingError | The auto-renewable subscription expired and billing retry wasnâ€™t able to recover the subscription.  The subscription is not entitled to service. |
