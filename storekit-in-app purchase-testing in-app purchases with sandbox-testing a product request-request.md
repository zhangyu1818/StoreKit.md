# Testing a product request

Verify that requests for products function properly in the sandbox environment by inspecting the App Store response.

## Overview

After setting a breakpoint in your code, use the list of product identifiers that you tested in Testing fetching product identifiers to create and submit an instance of SKProductsRequest. Then inspect the lists of valid and invalid product identifiers. If there are invalid product identifiers, review your products in App Store Connect and correct your JSON file or property list.

Note

Changes that you make to product metadata in App Store Connect can take up to one hour to appear in the sandbox environment.

See Testing invalid product identifier handling for more information.
