## Discussion

Use this JSON Web Signature (JWS) value to perform your own JWS verification on your server or on the device.

To verify the jwsRepresentation on your server, consider using the App Store Server Library function `verifyAndDecodeAppTransaction`, available in each language the library supports. For more information, see Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library.

The jwsRepresentationâ€™s decoded payload contains the fields `deviceVerification` and `deviceVerificationNonce`. Use these fields on the device to verify that the JWS information belongs to the device. For more information, see deviceVerificationID.
