## Overview

StoreKit automatically verifies the Transaction, Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo, and AppTransaction values. To access the wrapped values, check whether the values are verified or unverified.

In addition to getting a verification result from StoreKit, you might want to verify the signed information yourself, either on the device, or on your server for the most control and security. Perform the verification on the jwsRepresentation property for subscription renewal information, the jwsRepresentation property for transactions, and the jwsRepresentation property for an app transaction.

To verify the jwsRepresentation on your server, consider using the verification functions in the App Store Server Library. The library provides the functions `verifyAndDecodeTransaction`, `verifyAndDecodeAppTransaction`, and `verifyAndDecodeRenewalInfo` in each language the library supports. For more information, see Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library.

The jwsRepresentation string is in JWS Compact Serialization format and is the same as its counterpart in the App Store server APIs, as follows:

| StoreKit string | Equivalent in the App Store Server API | Equivalent in App Store Server Notifications |
|----|----|----|
| jwsRepresentation for subscription renewal information | JWSRenewalInfo | JWSRenewalInfo |
| jwsRepresentation for transactions | JWSTransaction | JWSTransaction |

The decoded payload of the jwsRepresentation contains two additional fields: `deviceVerification` and `deviceVerificationNonce`. Use these fields on the device to verify that JWS information belongs to the device. For more information, see deviceVerificationID.

Important

The decoded payloads of jwsRepresentation and JWSTransaction strings contain price or renewalPrice fields specified in *milliunits* of the currency. StoreKit represents the `price` and renewalPrice values in is *units* of the currency. Take care not to confuse these two representations when working with both APIs.
