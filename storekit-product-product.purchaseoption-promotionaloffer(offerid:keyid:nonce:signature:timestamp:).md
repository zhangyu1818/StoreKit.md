## Discussion

For information about `keyID`, `nonce`, `signature`, and `timestamp`, see Generating a signature for promotional offers. If youâ€™re providing an appAccountToken(_:) in the purchase options, you must include that value when you generate the `signature`. Use lowercase for the UUID string representations of the app account token and the `nonce` in the signature.

You can offer a discounted or free period of service for auto-renewable subscriptions on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS using promotional offers. Before you can provide promotional offers in your app, you must set up the offers in your App Store Connect account.
