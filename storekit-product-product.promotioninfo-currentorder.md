Supporting promoted In-App Purchases in your app

## Discussion

This asynchronous array returns a list of Product.PromotionInfo objects in the custom order they appear in on the device.

Note

This list is empty if you donâ€™t override the order, and the App Store displays the products in their default order.

For information about setting the default order using App Store Connect, see Promote in-app purchases.
