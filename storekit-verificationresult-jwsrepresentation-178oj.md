## Discussion

Use this JSON Web Signature (JWS) value to perform your own JWS verification on your server or on the device.

The jwsRepresentation is the same as the JWSRenewalInfo that the App Store Server API returns, and the JWSRenewalInfo that you receive from App Store Server Notifications. The jwsRepresentationâ€™s decoded payload contains two additional fields: `deviceVerification` and `deviceVerificationNonce`. Use these fields on the device to verify that the JWS information belongs to the device. For more information, see deviceVerificationID.

To verify the jwsRepresentation on your server, consider using the App Store Server Library function `verifyAndDecodeRenewalInfo`, available in each language the library supports. For more information, see Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library.

Important

The decoded payloads of the jwsRepresentation and JWSRenewalInfo strings contain renewalPrice fields that are specified in *milliunits* of the currency; StoreKit represents the renewalPrice in *units* of currency. Take care not to confuse these two representations when working with both APIs.
