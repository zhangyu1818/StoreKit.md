## Discussion

This method queries the App Store server to refresh the app transaction information. This method returns a VerificationResult that contains the App Store-signed app transaction information for your app.

Important

Calling refresh() displays a system prompt that asks users to authenticate with their App Store credentials. Call this function only in response to an explicit user action, like tapping or clicking a button.

Use this method to get an AppTransaction in the following cases:

- The shared property throws an error.

- The shared property returns an unverified (VerificationResult.unverified(_:_:) ) result.

This method throws an error if the user cancels the authentication prompt, if thereâ€™s no network connectivity, or if the call fails to update the app transaction.
