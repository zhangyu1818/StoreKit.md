## Discussion

The id is a string that contains the alphanumeric offer identifier you provide when you configure a subscription offer in App Store Connect.

This value is `nil` if the subscription offer is an introductory offer.

Pass the id to a method in purchase(options:) to create a purchase option based on the offerâ€™s type. For example, pass the id for a promotional offer to the promotionalOffer(offerID:signature:) to apply the promotion to a purchase.

For more information about configuring offers in App Store Connect, see Product.SubscriptionOffer.
