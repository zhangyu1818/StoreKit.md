## Discussion

The contents of this property are undefined except when transactionState is set to SKPaymentTransactionState.purchased.

The receipt is a signed chunk of data that can be sent to the App Store to verify that the payment was successfully processed. This is most useful when designing a store that uses a server separate from the iPhone to verify that payment was processed. For more information on verifying receipts, see Receipt Validation Programming Guide.
