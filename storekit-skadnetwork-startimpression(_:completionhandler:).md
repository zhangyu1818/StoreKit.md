Signing and providing ads

## Discussion

Call this method when you start presenting the view-through ad to the user. If you call startImpression(_:completionHandler:) more than once for the same advertised app before calling endImpression(_:completionHandler:), the latest impression overwrites the earlier impression.

Call endImpression(_:completionHandler:) when the impression ends and is no longer visible to the user.

Note

To ensure that SKAdNetwork records the impression, call endImpression(_:completionHandler:) after the impression ends, regardless of whether startImpression(_:completionHandler:) returns an error in the completion handler.
