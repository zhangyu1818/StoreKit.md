``` source
func callAsFunction(
    _ product: Product,
    options: Set = []
) async throws -> Product.PurchaseResult
```

## Parameters 

`product`  

The in-app purchase Product the customer is purchasing.

`options`  

A set of options you may associate with the purchase (Product.PurchaseOption).

## Return Value

The result of the purchase, Product.PurchaseResult.

## Discussion

Donâ€™t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the PurchaseAction structure with the `product` and `options` as arguments.

This method may throw a Product.PurchaseError or StoreKitError.
