# Testing at all stages of development with Xcode and the sandbox

Verify your implementation of In-App Purchases by testing your code throughout its development.

## Overview

Use the Apple sandbox and Xcode test environments to test your implementation of in-app purchases using the StoreKit framework. Comprehensive testing can help you:

- Ensure a seamless purchase flow to provide a positive customer experience in your app.

- Implement sound logic that covers all scenarios, such as purchases, restores, and subscription offers.

- Validate that purchases behave correctly in production after your app is available in the App Store.

The tools you need to test in-app purchases, non-renewing subscriptions, and auto-renewable subscriptions from early development through beta testing are:

StoreKit Testing in Xcode  
For early development, continuous integration, and debugging. For more information, see StoreKit Test.

Sandbox  
For testing scenarios using in-app purchase data you set up in App Store Connect. For more information, see Testing In-App Purchases with sandbox.

TestFlight  
For managing beta testing with internal and external testers. TestFlight uses a beta build of your app or App Clip that you upload to App Store Connect. For more information, see Beta Testing Made Simple with TestFlight.

Choose the tools that support the test scenarios you need. Make sure you’re able to perform the setup required for the tools you choose.

During the early stages of development, you may not be ready to configure in-app purchases in App Store Connect. StoreKit Testing in Xcode lets you configure the information locally. You can test StoreKit transactions before you create Sandbox Apple IDs, without a network connection. You can test your app in Simulator or on real devices.

After you set up in-app purchases in App Store Connect, start using the sandbox environment to test the product information your app will use in production. Testing in the sandbox lets you test transactions from end-to-end and from your app to your server. You can also test any server-to-server functionalities your app depends on, such as transaction validation and App Store Server Notifications.

TestFlight lets you get feedback from members of your team or from external testers. TestFlight uses the sandbox environment for in-app purchases. Transactions and purchases that occur in the sandbox don’t incur charges. The following table compares the test environments and features:

| Test environment | Requires App Store Connect setup | Provides receipts and JSON Web Signature (JWS) transactions signed by the App Store | Provides subscription renewal information signed by the App Store |
|----|----|----|----|
| StoreKit Testing in Xcode | No | No (signed by Xcode) | No (signed by Xcode) |
| Sandbox | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| TestFlight (uses the sandbox) | Yes | Yes | Yes |

None of the test environments charge users when they test buying a product. The App Store doesn’t send emails for purchases or refunds made in the test environments.

### Control the test environment

To set up and run test scenarios, you often need to control the test environment. For example, you may want to reset a test account to rerun the same test multiple times, or mimic actions users take outside your app that affect the test conditions. The following table shows the capabilities each tool has to control the test environment:

| Test scenario | Sandbox | StoreKit Testing in Xcode |
|----|----|----|
| Test different storefronts to affect price tiers and locale | Yes | Limited (no price tiers) |
| Clear the purchase history | Yes | Yes |
| Test subscription upgrades, downgrades, cross-grades, and auto-renew cancellations | Yes | Yes |
| Reset eligibility for introductory offers | Yes | Yes |
| Introduce forced StoreKit errors for testing | No | Yes |
| Speed up or slow down the rate of time for testing subscription renewals | Yes | Yes |

For more information about speeding up renewal periods for testing, see Test in-app purchases.

### Test common StoreKit scenarios

All apps that offer in-app purchases need to support restoring purchases, displaying in-app purchases to the customer, and handling basic transactions. The following table lists common test scenarios and whether they’re testable in the sandbox or Xcode:

| Test scenario | Sandbox | StoreKit Testing in Xcode |
|----|----|----|
| Restore purchases | Yes | Yes |
| Finish a transaction with finish() or finishTransaction(_:) | Yes | Yes |
| Buy a consumable or non-consumable in-app purchase | Yes | Yes |
| Repurchase a non-consumable purchase for repeated testing | Yes | Yes |
| Purchase an auto-renewable subscription | Yes | Yes |
| Purchase a non-renewing subscription | Yes | Yes |
| Refund an in-app purchase | Yes | Yes |
| Test an interrupted purchase, where the user must complete actions outside the app | Yes | Yes |
| Test a failed purchase attempt when payment authorization fails | Yes | Yes |
| Retrieve configured in-app purchases from App Store Connect | Yes | Yes (optionally); can also retrieve data from a StoreKit configuration file |
| Manage subscriptions within your app with showManageSubscriptions(in:) and manageSubscriptionsSheet(isPresented:) | Yes | Yes |
| Initiate a refund request. For more information, see Testing refund requests. | Yes | Yes |

### Test subscriptions and Ask to Buy

Depending on the in-app purchases your app offers, you may need to test scenarios that involve auto-renewing subscriptions, introductory offers, promotional offers, and Ask to Buy. The following table lists test scenarios and whether they’re testable in the sandbox or Xcode:

| Test scenario | Sandbox | StoreKit Testing in Xcode |
|----|----|----|
| Initiate an Ask to Buy transaction that results in a deferred state | Yes | Yes |
| Resolve an Ask to Buy transaction by approving or rejecting it | No | Yes |
| Redeem an introductory offer for an auto-renewable subscription | Yes | Yes |
| Redeem a promotional offer for an auto-renewable subscription | Yes | Yes |
| Redeem an offer code for an auto-renewable subscription | No | Yes |
| Process a subscription renewal | Yes | Yes |
| Process a revoked or refunded subscription | Yes | Yes |
| Respond to a customer canceling a subscription and disabling auto-renew | Yes | Yes |
| Respond to an expired subscription | Yes | Yes |
| Process a subscription upgrade or downgrade | Yes | Yes |
| Process a subscription cross-grade with the same or different duration | Yes | Yes |
| Test a price increase for an auto-renewable subscription | No | Yes |
| Test billing retry and billing grace period | Yes | Yes |
