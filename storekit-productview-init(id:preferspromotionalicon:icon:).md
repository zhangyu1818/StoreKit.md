``` source
nonisolated
init(
    id productID: Product.ID,
    prefersPromotionalIcon: Bool = false,
    @ViewBuilder icon: () -> Icon
) where PlaceholderIcon == AutomaticProductPlaceholderIcon
```

## Parameters 

`productID`  

The product identifier to load from the App Store.

`prefersPromotionalIcon`  

A Boolean value that indicates whether to use the promotional image from the App Store, if itâ€™s available. If this value is `true` and a promotional image for the product is available, the view displays it instead of the view you provide in the `icon` parameter.

`icon`  

A closure that returns the image the view displays when the system finishes loading the product from the App Store.

## Discussion

The product view displays a placeholder icon until the system finishes loading the product. After the product loads, the system uses the view you provide in the `icon` parameter, by default. If `prefersPromotionalIcon` is `true` and the product has a promotional image, the view displays the promotional image as its icon instead of the provided view.

Tip

To gain more control over the image that decorates this view, use the init(id:icon:placeholderIcon:) initializer. It receives a ProductIconPhase, which enables you to supply an image for each phase of the image-loading process.
