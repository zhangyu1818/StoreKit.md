## Discussion

Use this value to determine which app version the customer first purchased or downloaded. This value is comparable to the appVersion value.

The originalAppVersion remains constant and doesnâ€™t change when the customer upgrades the app. The string value contains the original value of the CFBundleShortVersionString for apps running in macOS, and the original value of the CFBundleVersion for apps running on all other platforms.

In the sandbox testing environment, the originalAppVersion value is always `1.0`.
