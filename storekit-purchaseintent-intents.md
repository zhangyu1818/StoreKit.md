## Discussion

Your app receives a purchase intent when customers initiate a purchase outside of your app by selecting a promoted product on the App Store, or redeeming a win-back offer. Use the product object to complete your appâ€™s purchase workflow, including finishing the purchase, unlocking the product, and any other workflows specific to your app.

The following example code receives the purchase intent, and calls a method to complete the purchase workflow:

```
func purchaseProduct(_ product: Product) async {
    // Complete the purchase workflow.
    do {
        try await product.purchase()
    }
    catch {
        // Add your code to handle errors.
    }
    // Add your code for the remaining purchase workflow.
}

for await purchaseIntent in PurchaseIntent.intents {
    // Receive the purchase intent and then complete the purchase workflow.
    await purchaseProduct(purchaseIntent.product)
}

```
